  <body>
    <p>First link is in the manually reviewed CSV and should pass (no network call):</p>
    <a href="http://localhost:9876/status/200">Manually approved - exact match</a>
    <p>
      Second link is NOT in the manually reviewed CSV and should fail (tests non-matching URLs):
    </p>
    <a href="http://site.invalid/url-is-accepted-as-existing-and-never-checked"
      >Manually reviewed URL - NOT in CSV</a
    >

    <p>
      This link has the same prefix but different suffix - should fail (exact match required, makes
      network call):
    </p>
    <a
      href="http://localhost:9876/status/200/page-that-is-404-that-happens-to-have-status-200-prefix"
      >Not exact match - should make network call and fail</a
    >
