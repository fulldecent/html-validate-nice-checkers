    <!-- TODO: Add a test case for an HTTP link that CAN be upgraded to HTTPS.
         This would require either:
         1. Setting up an HTTPS mock server with a self-signed certificate, or
         2. Using a real external URL that supports both HTTP and HTTPS
         When added, we should expect a violation like:
         "Insecure link can be upgraded to HTTPS: http://example-upgradeable-site/page" -->
